# HiC
Guides for processing HiC data











## Notes for me from installation of HiCExplorer:

https://github.com/deeptools/HiCExplorer/archive/refs/tags/3.7.zip

Note: HiC-Pro for resolutions at 5kb, 10kb, lower resolutions using merge in HiCExplorer
will re-do HiCPro at only these resolutions to conserve storage space
